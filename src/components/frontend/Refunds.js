      We endeavour to provide the best quality products every single time you
      order with us.
      <br />
      <br />
      We have a "no questions asked return and refund policy" which entitles all
      our customers to return the product at the time of delivery if they are
      not satisfied with the quality, freshness or physical condition of the
      product. At the time of delivery, we will take the returned product back
      with us and if already paid the corresponding value would be refunded to
      you through the same mode of payment used at the time of purchase viz.,
      credit card, debit card, net banking. Alternatively, at your option, the
      said amount can be credited to your store credit account which can be used
      for your subsequent purchases. After the delivery, the amount shall be
      refunded to you through the same mode of payment or via credit to your
      store credit account which can be used for subsequent purchases.
      <br />
      <br />
      Products once sold and delivered to you, shall be eligible for return only
      if the product condition is found to be damaged, broken, faulty or
      different from the ordered one. You can return the product(s), purchased
      from us under your order as per below, provided the product(s) packs are
      sealed/unopened/unused and in original condition.

      We do not make any cash refunds. In case of prepaid orders, if any part of
      it remains short delivered due to some reason, corresponding value would
      be refunded to you through the same mode of payment used at the time of
      purchase viz., credit card, debit card, net banking . The amount will be
      refunded to you between 3-15 working days depending upon the mode of
      payment chosen by you. Sometimes banks or financial intermediaries take a
      longer time to process the refund request. However, if the refund does not
      happen by the date advised, you may contact us and we will gladly help
      you. Alternatively at your option, the said amount can be credited to your
      store credit account which can be used for your subsequent purchases.
